# AnovaDevicesApi

In order to start the Api, simply use the "docker-compose up --build" targetting the "docker-compose.yml" file.

The Api uses the "Swagger" tool to better describe its structure.
There is also a .xml file, "DevicesApi.xml" that might be helpful when learning how to interact with the Api.

The current version does not contain any unit or integration tests.
